# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Customer Churn Prediction Model** using Machine Learning techniques.  
The objective is to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue a service based on historical data.

Customer churn prediction enables businesses to proactively identify at-risk customers and take preventive measures to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company's product or service within a given period.

High churn rates can:
- Reduce revenue
- Increase customer acquisition costs
- Affect long-term business growth

This project aims to:
- Analyze customer data
- Identify churn patterns
- Build a predictive classification model
- Evaluate performance using standard ML metrics

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

- Customer demographics
- Subscription details
- Service usage information
- Billing and payment details
- Churn status (Target Variable)

### Target Variable:
- `0` → Customer Retained  
- `1` → Customer Churned

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Class imbalance analysis

### 3️⃣ Model Building
Algorithm used includes:
- Logistic Regression

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

> Note: Recall is particularly important in churn prediction to correctly identify customers who are likely to leave.
